    <!--Heading for pudding insructions-->
    <h4>Pudding</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180℃ (350℉). Ovens are temperamental, 
            so if you know yours needs a bit more (or less) of a push, feel free to adjust.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add your first 4 ingredients - butter, sugar, jam and egg.<br>
            Beat until it lightens and gets a bit fluffier. If you only have a fork, the fluffy part isn't make-or-break.</li>
        <li>In a large measuring cup or a bowl, add milk, then vinegar and vanilla essence. Whisk lightly.</li>
        <li>In another measuring cup/bowl, add bicarb to flour and give it a quick stir.</li>
        <li>Alternating between the milk mixture and the flour, add to the large mixing bowl and mix well as you go along.</li>
        <li>Pour into a lightly greased oven-proof dish (ours was 30x15cm, but it could definitely have been a bit smaller).</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes, or until a knife comes out with spongy crumbs stuck to it, rather than uncooked batter.<br>
            The pudding will stay in its mold and rest for a bit once the sauce is poured over.</li>
    <br>
    </ol>
    <!--Separate heading for sauce instructions-->
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Add all sauce ingredients together in a pot and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Let it simmer, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. This time will give the sauce a richer, deeper taste.</li>
    <li>Stab the pudding a few times with a fork to help the sauce sink in so that it<br>
        doesn't pool at the sides and soak in only there.<br>
        Then pour the sauce over slowly, being sure you're not leaving any part dry.</li>
    </ol>
